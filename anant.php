      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <hr>
         <div class = early>
      <p> I was born in Seattle, WA on July 14th 1998. I have lived in Washington all my life except from 1st-3rd grade when I lived in India. I have been playing the drums since I was in 5th grade and played in my schools jazz bands from 6th thru 12th grade, and eventually playing at some jazz clubs in Seattle. I have always loved to build things. I've always played sports and in high-school settled into rowing. I rowed for 4 years at the Sammamish Rowing Association where I won multiple Northwest regional championships, and have been ranked 6th nationally. While in highschool I came to appreciate a sense of interdisciplinary learning. Blending the arts, with math and science has always fascinated me following the works of DaVinci, Escher, and Hofstadter. This idea led me to the University of Rochester with it's open curriculum and ability to chose. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      <div class = ed>
      <p>I graduated from U-Prep, Seattle WA in 2016 and am currently enrolled at the <em>University of Rochester</em>. I am currently a Junior and have switched my major 4 times while here. I was admitted as Mechanical Engineer, switched to optics, switched to economics, and finally settled with computer science. I played Rugby at the UofR my freshman year, and now play Lacrosse. I am also a brother of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and Design Chairman. </p>

      <p> I came to appreciate computer science as it was the first time in a major I found I was able to bring in other passions like art, building, design so early in a major, and was really fascinated by my discrete math course. I was then enrolled into more code heavy courses like Introduction to Computer Science (Java), Web Design and Development, and Data Structures and Algorithms. These classes were where I really started to feel like I could bring in my passion for imagining, designing, and building things. Simultaneously I was taking studio arts classes. Although the final products were in an abstract form in terms of programs, there was a certain satisfaction with completing a project end to end and having everything work which made it feel less abstract and more real than ever. I was creating responsive programs and was able to stylize and design how it all looked end to end. My Current computer science courses are Advanced Front-end Web Design, Formal Systems and Computations, and Writing for Computer Science.</p>
