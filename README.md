### Choreography:  
* Main page will come first implementing Z-Design. Top Left will have the University of Rochester Logo as point 1, traverses to the far right to point 2 where Nav menu will give you the options to go the through the 3 students. Slideshow of students faces will be in the center hitting the diagonal path of the eye. When we reach point 3 we will have a brief description of the webpage simialar to the domain breakdown above. Moving to point 4 we will have a next arrow button which takes you to the first student. The first two shall be related: Anant/Akshay in terms of attending the University of Rochester vs Elon Musk who attended Queens University in Canada.

* F-Design will be implemented on the pages of students. Start point will be top left with an image and a name underneath. Traverse to the right to see Nav menu again. Then down to point 3 on the stem of the F we see Early Life information. Following the natural path of the eye we move to point 4 where we see 3 descriptive traits of each student. This is relavent infrmation but not as important. Folowing back down to point 5 we have more information this time regarding education and job history. Then close with the CSC 174 footer and a next button to go the next student.
